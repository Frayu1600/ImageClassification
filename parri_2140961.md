## Abstract

This is the report for the **second homework** of the Machine Learning course directed by Luca Iocchi for the Academic Year 24/25 for the Master's Degree in **Artificial Intellingence and Robotics** at Sapienza University of Rome.

In this homework, the goal was to ... and draw conclusions.

**Note**: Generative AI has been utilized in this project solely as inspiration for the code. The project in its entirety has been developed **individually** without any other external collaborators, including this report.

The **hardware** utilized to train the models is Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU (8GB VRAM) with driver version 560.35.03 and CUDA version 12.6 on Ubuntu 24.04.01 LTS x86_64 and 16GB of RAM.
