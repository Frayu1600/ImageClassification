## Abstract

This is the report for the **second homework** of the Machine Learning course directed by Luca Iocchi for the Academic Year 24/25 for the Master's Degree in **Artificial Intellingence and Robotics** at Sapienza University of Rome.

In this homework, the goal was to learn a model that would learn how to drive a **2D top-view** car in a road with left and right turns taken from gymnasium's [car racing](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/car_racing/) environment.

The (supervised) dataset for the problem is composed of screenshots each of size $(96 \times 96 \times 3)$ and has been provided by the **professor itself** already split between training an test samples as shown in the following table

<div style="margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            width: 60%">

| Class label     |  Training samples    | Test samples  |
|  ---          | :---:           | :---:   |
| `do nothing` | 1000 | 133 |
| `steer left` | 1500 | 275 |  
| `steer right` | 1500 | 406 |  
| `gas` | 2000 | 1896 |
| `brake` | 369 | 39 | 
| **TOTAL** | 6369 (69.9%) | 2749 (30.1%)

</div>

There were no attempts at trying to balance the dataset due to the **low amount** of samples for each class. Of the above training samples, $\frac{1}{5}$ where used for validation, and multiple **random states** of these splits have been tested for variability.

**Note**: Generative AI has been utilized in this project solely as inspiration for the code. The project in its entirety has been developed **individually** without any other external collaborators, including this report.

The **hardware** utilized to train the models is Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU (8GB VRAM) with driver version 560.35.03 and CUDA version 12.6 on Ubuntu 24.04.01 LTS x86_64 and 16GB of RAM.
